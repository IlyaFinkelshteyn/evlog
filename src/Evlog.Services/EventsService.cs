Implementing any machine learning algorithm is bunch of drag and drops that you need to in Azure ML Studio. \n\nIn this webinar you will be learning what machine learning is and how to choose an algorithm for your problem. Five questions to ask on choosing ML algorithm. Below are the agenda for our webinar: \n\nArtificial Intelligence Vs Machine learning Vs Deep learning \nWhat is Naive Bayes? \nWhat is feature and label? \nDifference between R and Python?",
